# Calcu-date

## Description

We decided to go for a fun, cheeky app that has some nostalgiac elements reminiscent of the magic 8 balls/ fortune teller machines we played with as kids, but also has the added usability of being able to search the streaming libraries for a good first date movie. the pulsating heart button is the centerpiece of this app, and stays on the center of the page as you navigate. The love calculator API gives a unique result based on the two inputs (names) that are used. These results are a percentage match and a note about that match. We then used the percentage result to from this API to dictate to our 2nd API which type of movie to recommend (example: a 17% match would recommend a horror movie while a 89% match would recommend a romantic comedy).

## User Story

## Acceptance Criteria
